## How to configure?

In the bot folder have two files: ``config.json`` and ``bot.js``, they can control the most of functions and values in the bot and are the configuration files

### Configuring config.json

Set your values without editing any key name, add your bot token in the token space, if want help, open a issue and the Core Reactor or the community gonna help you

### Configuring bot.js

It's more complex to edit bot.js, don't edit unless you know what you're doing
